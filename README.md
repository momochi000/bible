# Bible app

## Project Overview
This is a ClojureScript project using the Clojure CLI tools (deps.edn) for dependency management.

### Project Context and purpose
The project is to create a (Christian) Bible app which is compiled into a single HTML file with no external dependencies. It is intended to be saved on a mobile phone (android or iphone) and be usable offline fully self-contained (although it should be usable from any device with a browser as well).
